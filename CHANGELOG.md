# TShock for Terraria

This is the rolling changelog for TShock for Terraria. Use past tense when adding new entries; sign your name off when you add or change something. This should primarily be things like user changes, not necessarily codebase changes unless it's really relevant or large.

## Unreleased

* Fixed a bug where /user group failing would output no error. (@nicatronTg)
* Fixed a bug where /user group would fail. @(Enerdy)
* Added the ability to disable backup autosave messages. (@nicatronTg)

## TShock 4.3.0.0

* API: Modifed NetItem so that it's actually useful. (@MarioE)
* Updated prebuilts (SQLite, JSON, MySQL) to latest versions. (@nicatronTg)
* Added a minimum password length to prevent blank passwords. (@nicatronTg)
* Modified item ban checks to provide which item is disabling a player in the logs. (@Enerdy)
* API: Modified TSPlayer to store a user, and deprecated calls to TSPlayer.User.ID. (@WhiteXZ)
* Modified chat color specs in config file to be int arrays rather than floats. (@nicatronTg)
* Modified verbiage for ```/auth``` and ```/auth-verify``` to make it clearer how they operate. (@nicatronTg)
* API: Added fuzzy name searching for users. (@WhiteXZ)
* API: Fixed ```OnPlayerLogout``` not being fired when a player disconnects. (@nicatronTg)
* API: Deprecated ```ValidString``` and ```SanitizeString``` methods in Utils. (@nicatronTg)
* Added BCrypt password hashing and related systems for it. BCrypt replaces the old system using non-password hashing algorithms for storing passwords. It breaks implementations of the login code that were manually recreated, but is otherwise seamless in transition. (@nicatronTg)
* API: Added ```User.VerifyPassword(string password)``` which verifies if the user's password matches their stored hash. It automatically upgrades a users' password to BCrypt if called and the password stored is not a BCrypt hash. (@nicatronTg)
* API: Deprecated ```Utils.HashPassword``` and related password hashing functions as those are no longer needed for plugin access. (@nicatronTg)
* Fixed ```UseServerName``` config option so that it correctly sends the config server name any time that Main.WorldName is used. (@Olink)
* Fixed a bug where people could ban themselves. (@nicatronTg)
* Fixed a bug where banning a player who never logged in caused problems. (@nicatronTg)
* Terraria 1.3.0.3 support.
